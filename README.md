**MARKET BASKET ANALYSIS**

This project contains the code and data for performing Market Basket Analysis with the Apriori method. Apriori is a retail and e-commerce approach that identifies patterns and links between commonly purchased products.

**Introduction**

Market Basket Analysis is an important part of understanding customer behavior since it allows firms to optimize product positioning, marketing methods, and promotions. This repository includes a Python version of the Apriori technique for extracting association rules from a transaction dataset. #Requirements I installed the following to run the code in this repository: Pandas with NumPy in Python


**Dataset**

The dataset for this analysis is available in the data directory.

**Algorithm**

The apriori_algorithm.py script contains an implementation of the Apriori algorithm. The script's modular structure allows you to easily alter parameters like minimum support, confidence, and lift thresholds.

**Results**

The results of the Market Basket Analysis, including discovered association rules and support/confidence metrics, will be displayed.
